Making a DNN Classifier using tensor-flow

## Description
In statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. Examples are assigning a given email to the "spam" or "non-spam" class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.). Classification is an example of pattern recognition.

For this model I used Iris dataset from keras module in tensorflow. For making predictions I take inputs from user for the various feature according to which it displays the most probable plant species.
